&lt;p&gt;My love for Dr Richard Feynman started with my life at IIT-Madras.  If you ever wonder, I knew him and you did not; don’t worry. I did not. And, to this date; I felt it is a shame not knowing him earlier enough.  Everything on Feynman started with the book   “&lt;strong&gt;Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman&lt;/strong&gt;!”  When I started reading the book, I was intrigued by the way he was telling how he played with Physics, been part of atomic project, ran experiments, played around with one of the first kind of parallel processing algorithms, cracking safe, playing Bongos and even to go to great extends on simplicity in proving questions in Physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are getting curious, have a look at&lt;/p&gt;
