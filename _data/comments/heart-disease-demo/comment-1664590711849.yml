message: "I think that what you said made a lot of sense. However, think about this, suppose you added a little information? I am not saying your information isn't solid,\r\nhowever what if you added something that makes people desire more?\r\nI mean Heart Disease Demo: How much risk for a single patient has - \r\nDossiers is kinda plain. You should look at Yahoo's home page and see how they create article titles to get \r\nviewers to click. You might try adding a video or a picture or two to grab \r\npeople interested about everything've got to say.\r\nIn my opinion, it would make your posts a little livelier."
