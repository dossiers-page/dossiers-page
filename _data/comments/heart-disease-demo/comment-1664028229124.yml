message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and \r\nsaid \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" \r\nShe placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit \r\ncrab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!"
