message: "With havin so much written content do you ever run into any problems of plagorism or copyright violation? My blog has a \r\nlot of exclusive content I've either created myself \r\nor outsourced but it seems a lot of it is popping it up all over the web without my \r\npermission. Do you know any techniques to help reduce content from \r\nbeing ripped off? I'd really appreciate it."
