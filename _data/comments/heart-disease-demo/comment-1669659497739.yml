message: "Howdy just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The words in your post seem to be running off the screen in Chrome.\r\nI'm not sure if this is a format issue or something to do with web browser compatibility but I \r\nfigured I'd post to let you know. The style and design look great though!\r\n\r\nHope you get the issue fixed soon. Thanks"
