This is created using onion routing. Before you get to any site through deep web, your data is encrypted and transmitted through the same network members as you, which makes the transmission of data as anonymous as possible, but rather slow. Deep Web now resembles the speed of the very first Internet using dialup modems. The sites are on it are encrypted with the domain names .onion. It was Tor that created the largest onion network. It is a network in which there are no rules, laws, and countries.What can be purchased in the domain zone .onion? Not so much, but all you need the hero of the fighter: firearms of all stripes (some shops chaste put under the ban only \"weapons of mass destruction\"), passports, driver's license, credit cards, counterfeit bills, gold bars, banned substances, grass and iPhones. They say you can still buy killers, slaves or human organs.\r\n\r\nHow to get on the Dark Web Technically, this is not a difficult process. You simply need to install and use Tor. Go to www.torproject.org and download the Tor Browser, which contains all the required tools. Run the downloaded file, choose an extraction location, then open the folder and click Start Tor Browser. That's it. The Vidalia Control Panel will automatically handle the randomised network setup and, when Tor is ready, the browser will open; just close it again to disconnect from the network. \r\n \r\nExclusive to the dossiers.page\r\nOnion Urls and Links Tor - http://onionlinks.biz - Links to onion sites tor browser"
