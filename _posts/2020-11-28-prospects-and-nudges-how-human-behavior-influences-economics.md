Do you often 

1. Think your loss of a 1000 bucks is compensated well by gain of 2000
2. Feel that there was already 3 negative incidents in a day and you made a 4th mistake just because you were pissed off with the earlier 3 incidents?
3. Put money in buckets (emergency, outing, shopping, school) 
4. Procastenate the investment plans and retirement plans
5. If you reviewed your own slides/proposals after 6 months, feel that "did I write that crap" 
6. Often take easier bets in office than taking risky routes because the reward is not worth the risk?

I do think and act in these manner and interestingly found out that I am not really a rational economist (ECON) and I am one of the most 99.999999 percent persons. 

I thought this was an obvious fact and political and economic think tanks would have already made theories about this. It came as a shocking surprise to me that this field of behavioral economics is very new and all the market theories and policies formed never considered human errors and procastenating behaviors. More interestingly, the stock market investments, the retirement plans to everything we believed in had lousy foundations till late 90's.  This is also the reason to over-invest in certain type of markets and the crashes that followed (like the housing bubble in USA). 

So, how do we take care of ourselves if 99.9999999999s of us are this way and often the others too in most of the emotional situations. How do we improve the voluntury sign up for organ donations, making people to save more for future, making better judgement about stock market collapses by overinvesting?  

This is exactly what is narrated in the book *Misbehaving, Making of behavioral economics* is talking about. It is one hell of a journey by Prof Richard Thaler of fights with traditional thinkers of economics to study such anomalies and the way these studies went into making policies for USA, UK and eventually to many other countries.

This is a complementary read to the most popular book by Kanheman who created the prospect theory "Thinking Fast and Slow"
